Project Overview: 

This project focuses on forecasting the market capitalisation of companies listed on the London Stock Market using time series analysis in R. It aims to uncover growth patterns, seasonality, and potential future trends in market performance.

Objectives: 

Clean and prepare historical market capitalisation data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply time series forecasting model (ARIMA)

Evaluate model accuracy using error metrics

Visualize past trends and future projections

Tools & Technologies: 

R (Primary programming language)

forecast and tseries (Time series modeling)

ggplot2 (Data visualization)

Methodology: 

Data Collection

Historical market cap data for LSE-listed companies 

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, formatting dates, and filtering relevant stock data

EDA & Visualization

Identified trends, seasonality, and anomalies in historical market cap figures

Modeling: 

Used models ARIMA for time series forecasting

Compared model performance using RMSE, MAPE, and AIC values

Forecasting:

Predicted future market capitalisation and visualized results

Key Findings
The London Stock Market shows clear seasonal trends with consistent annual cycles.

ARIMA provided the best fit with the lowest forecasting error.

Forecast suggests a moderate growth trajectory over the next years.
